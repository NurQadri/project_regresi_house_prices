# Welcome to My Regression Project (House Price)
A repository that contains regression projects. Comparing multiple regression models in the case of house prices
This project contains an analysis of house prices in King County based on several factors. It will look for what factors have the most influence on house prices. Several regression models are also built with the aim of seeing which model performs best in modeling the data. The data set can be downloaded at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction?resource=download

## File Descriptions
There are only 2 files in this repository (except the README file)

- Project 1 Regression Model (House Prices).ipynb is a jupyter notebook that can be run on Google Colab. This file contains step by step about house price analysis and modeling.
- kc_house_datakaggle.csv is the dataset file used in this project.

## Model Descriptions
The base model used in this project is Ordinary Linear Regression. In addition, we also built Ridge and Lasso Regression models. Furthermore, we perform hyperparameter tuning by giving some parameters at the beginning before the training process, finally we try to perform hyperparameter tuning by applying the concept of Cross Validation.
